      <p>
        I'm a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">independent open source software developer</span>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through">tortured artist</span> mostly eukaryotic multicellular form of life from
        &amp; presently residing in Hamburg, Germany.<br>
        <br>
        Having grown up in a multilingual and -cultural environment, I've cultivated an avid passion for my native Spanish
        (Chilean/Andalusian dialect) and German (Northern Germany/Hamburg dialect), as well as English (British English,) at
        CEFR level C1 according to personal judgment, and Classical Arabic as classical language. As circumstances would have
        it, this came to include languages habitually spoken solely by computers within the context of the fields of systems
        programming and engineering on predominantly UNIX-like and, to some extent, Windows platforms.<br>
        <br>
        I have a strong interest in the intersection of creativity, spoken languages, oral poetry on one hand and, on the other,
        expressiveness and an emphasis on aesthetic qualities in programming and engineering with a view to design and implement
        maintainable, composable, and well-documented software, preferentially eschewing abstraction and overly complicated code
        poor in breadth of expressive modalities.<br>
        <br>
        In my spare time, I like to occasionally write <a href="/<?php echo $inc_lang ?>/stories">short stories and poems</a>, draw
        <a href="/<?php echo $inc_lang ?>/visual_sundries">digital art</a> depicting the futile absurdities of the human condition and
        existence in general, translate <a href="/<?php echo $inc_lang ?>/arabic_poems">Arabic poetry</a>, compose gargantuan walls of
        text on <a href="/<?php echo $inc_lang ?>/etc">experimental transfeminine endocrinology</a>, take long walks whilst pondering the
        phenomenological implications of alphabet soup, <a href="/<?php echo $inc_lang ?>/movieslist">watch films and series</a>,
        <a href="/<?php echo $inc_lang ?>/etc">cook</a>, and impose long, drawn-out sentences upon
        <a href="https://github.com/lalbornoz/PuTTie/blob/master/PuTTie/README.md">project README files</a> or
        <a href="https://www.luciaillanes.de">websites</a>.<br>
        <br>
        I have participated in and continue to participate in open source projects. Please refer to
        <a href="/<?php echo $inc_lang ?>/projects">Open source projects involvement</a> on this website as well as
        <a href="https://github.com/lalbornoz/">my GitHub</a> for further information.<br>
