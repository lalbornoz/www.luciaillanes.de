      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm an independent open source software developer from &amp; presently residing in Hamburg, Germany.<br>
        <br>
        Having grown up in a multilingual and -cultural environment, I've cultivated an avid passion for my native Spanish
        (Chilean/Andalusian dialect) and German (Northern Germany/Hamburg dialect), as well as English (British English,) at
        CEFR level C1 according to personal judgment, and Classical Arabic plus an assortment of dialects at CEFR level A2-B1. As
        circumstances would have it, this came to include languages habitually spoken solely by computers within the context of the
        fields of systems programming and engineering on predominantly UNIX-like and, to some extent, Windows platforms.<br>
        <br>
        I have a strong interest in the intersection of creativity, spoken languages, oral poetry on one hand and, on the other,
        expressiveness and an emphasis on aesthetic qualities in programming and engineering with a view to design and implement
        maintainable, composable, and well-documented software, preferentially eschewing abstraction and overly complicated code
        poor in breadth of expressive modalities.<br>
        <br>
        In my spare time, I like to occasionally write <a href="/EN/stories/">short stories and poems</a>, draw <a href="/EN/etc/">comics</a>
        depicting the futile absurdities of the human condition and existence in general, translate <a href="/EN/arabic_poems">Arabic poetry</a>
        (badly,) compose gargantuan walls of text on applied transfeminine endocrinology, take long walks whilst pondering
        the phenomenological implications of alphabet soup, offer sacrifices to Enki and Labata IÅ¡tar, <a href="/EN/etc/">cook</a>,
        and impose long, drawn-out sentences upon <a href="https://github.com/lalbornoz/PuTTie/blob/master/PuTTie/README.md">project README files</a>
        or <a href="https://www.luciaillanes.de">websites</a> for reasons left unspecified.<br>
        <br>
        I have participated in and continue to participate in open source projects. Please refer to
        <a href="/EN/projects">Open source projects involvement</a> on this website as well as
        <a href="https://github.com/lalbornoz/">my GitHub</a> for further information.<br>
