أُريدُ مِن زَمَني ذا أَن يُبَلِّغَني<br>
ما لَيسَ يَبلُغُهُ مِن نَفسِهِ الزَمَنُ<br>
<br>
لا تَلقَ دَهرَكَ إِلّا غَيرَ مُكتَرِثٍ<br>
مادامَ يَصحَبُ فيهِ روحَكَ البَدَنُ<br>
<br>
فَما يَدومُ سُرورٌ ما سُرِرتَ بِهِ<br>
وَلا يَرُدُّ عَلَيكَ الفائِتَ الحَزَنُ<br>

I desire of my days<a href="#r2" class="a-reference">[2]</a> to reunite me with that<br>
which time of itself can never obtain<a href="#r3" class="a-reference">[3]</a><br>
<br>
Do not meet your fate except with indifference<br>
as long as your soul still accompanies your body<br>
<br>
For what has pleased you in the past has not lasted<br>
nor may sorrow return what has passed<br>

[1] viz. the wannabe or would-be prophet - on one hand, as a Laqab goes, e.g. nickname, honorific, title, etc. by which a person was primarily known, defining them at their most essential, his Laqab indeed defines the poet at his most essential: arrogant, daring, and quite adept at getting himself into trouble. On the other, said Laqab derives from a specific event in the poet's life where he literally declared himself to a prophet (Nabī) whilst living with the nomadic tribe b. Kalb, among others - to then lead a Qārmaṭian revolt in Syria in 932, which led to his imprisonment for 2 years, after which he recanted, became a wandering poet, and eventually ended up in the Ḥamdanid court of Sayfu d-Dawlah, his primary patron and object of numerous panegyric poems.<br>

<span id="r2">
[2] viz. the days, one's days, time, fate, destiny - the pre-Islāmic Arabs did not truly believe in anything except for time - time ruins all - and this sentiment carried forth into Islām and Arab perspectives on life and death and everything in between.<br>

<span id="r3">
[3] Even time cannot defy itself, nothing can. Fate, destiny, time is the only thing that is truly absolute and irrevocable.<br>
