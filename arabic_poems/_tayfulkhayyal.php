    The trope of "Ṭayfu l-Ḫayyāl" - lit. apparition, ghost, spectrum of/in the (one's) imagination, mind, being, spirit, shadow - is of major significance in love (ġazal) poetry with origins in cultural and poetic traditions and tropes stretching back to ancient days and difficult to translate owing to context.<br>

    As such, it simply refers to a vision, in the sense of a being inasmuch as the "visionary" experience thereof, in a dream, the words for which in Arabic do also have connotations of and relations with the notion of a vision as well as things that are hoped for and wished for, as opposed to simply seen without any other implicit meaning. Specifically, a beloved person, whether dead or alive, that one has previously departed from or vice versa, very often owing to tribal, political, social, etc. circumstances less so than volition - or simply fate - which is seen as torment and yet also blissful.<br>

    The origins of this trope go as far back as to the tradition of the pre-Islāmic - moreso semi-nomadic/nomadic - Arabs to stop and halt by the traces of the former campsite of their beloved to engage in remembrance thereof, as if to momentarily bring their being, their spirit back - at least within the confines of their minds, Ṭayf can be taken as to mean either of spirit or mind - and then weep, such as in the famous poem of Imruʔu l-Qays: "Let us stop and weep for the memory of my beloved and where once she had dwelt / by Siqṭi l-Liwā, between the deserts of Duḫūl and Ḥawmal" - and, of course, making these places a recurring object and subject of travel in actual reality and poetry.<br>
    <br>
    By the Umayyad and certainly ʕabbāsid era and the inevitable evolution of Arabic poetry that came along with them, this was further developed into the trope of "Ṭayfu l-Ḫayyāl" in the nascent genre of love (ġazal) poetry.<br>
