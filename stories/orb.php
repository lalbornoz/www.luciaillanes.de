    Expedition into the Pale
    </h1>

    <p class="text-red">
    ...of course, she was only distracting herself, with good reason. She had only just, for the lack
    of a more suitable term, concluded a, by and large, terminally inconclusive relationship. Much
    like wine of mediocre quality, little was left thereof the next morning but foul, fading traces
    of bitter regret with subtle notes of time less spent than wasted and the sundry aromas of many
    an unfulfilled promise. She sighed. She stared at empty space for some time but her stare was
    not reciprocated. She gently obliged her unresolved stare bereft of reciprocity to resolve itself
    towards an object of apprehension more fit to be stared at. Surely, there would be something, she
    thought. There was. "Logbook of the Expedition into the Pale, 19 August 1913", her stare reported
    back to her, with a certain air of satisfaction. Distraction. She caught herself commencing to
    sigh and decided to gather her bearings instead, one by one, however many there may be.<br>
    <br>
    Earlier, during an erratic morning walk driven largely by her desire to be somewhere totally
    different for at least a while, she had succeeded at getting totally and entirely lost. This,
    at least, offered a temporary refuge of novelty sprinkled with an uncanny air of the remote
    and forgotten. Oddly enough, by the time she had decided that she wanted to no longer be lost,
    nobody seemed to know how to get to that particular place she had presumably come from nor,
    for that matter, anywhere else. In fact, she could but barely recall how she managed to find
    her way home or how to get back to where she had been anew. Shame, she thought, for all the
    intriguing boutiques, if slightly shabby, selling, almost somewhat eerily, seemingly useless
    items and trinkets of no apparent value that nevertheless left an irresistible imprint on some
    obscure corner of the subconscious mind patiently awaiting an opportunity to impose its dominion
    over the rest of her mind.<br>
    <br>
    She paused. What a thought, she thought. She stashed all other such thoughts, especially those
    pertaining to said place, and stashed her stash of thoughts in some remote corner of her mind for
    later retrieval. For the time being, she had procured an object worthy of apprehension: "Logbook
    of the Expedition into the Pale, 19 August 1913". Whatever that means. And an orb. Apparently
    they were connected, somehow. Or so she had been told. Or so she thought she had been told. The
    salesperson at the boutique she had bought both at only spoke, as she had been told by his
    equally linguistically impaired attendant, an obscure descendant of 12th century Andalusian
    Arabic spoken in scattered patches of tribal territories all over the Sahel region. That,
    and the universal language of wild gesticulation.<br>
    <br>
    One way or another, she was now in possession of an obscure logbook dating to late 1913 and
    an orb. She liked the orb at first sight. It reminded her of her fascination, obsession even,
    with kaleidoscopes when she was a child. When she would stare at, into, the orb, a dazzling,
    swirling, disarray of colours and shapes, constantly shifting and changing, would eventually
    assemble itself into some indescribable something that almost seemed to behold a secret mystery
    hidden profoundly within her very being, as remote as familiar, and she felt irresistibly drawn
    to it. Then, a subtle, bright green radiance emanated from the orb and began to encompass the
    sudden vastness of her consciousness. She blinked. She had blinked. Was she still there? What
    a thought, she thought. Apparently, she had all but forgotten of all the reasons that demanded
    distraction of her, a faint voice remarked somewhere but it went unheard.<br>
    <br>
    She sat down at her desk and began to read the logbook, the orb sat on a worn-out, decorative
    pillow in front of her.

    Logbook of the Expedition into the Pale, 19 August 1913<br>
    <br>
    Earlier this morning, after two long years of preparation, I have concluded assembling a crew
    suitable for the task at hand, furnishing said crew, myself included, with a longboat suitable
    for traversing the Pale as well all provisions and equipment required, obtained all permits due,
    and we offered prayers also to all the deities to whom prayers are due in such circumstances,
    to Inanna-Ištar, the Mistress of the innumerable me, to Īnkuzén, the Golden-Eyed, Sovereign
    of Origins, to Ereškigal, and Nisaba. None of the men and women I have contracted to render
    their duty and, should it come to that, very souls to, are, in the most remote sense of the
    word, fit for this mission and, I am afraid to say, nor am I. I have not informed them of the
    true nature of this mission. What little I know of it shall remain my burden, for the time
    being. Surely, unimaginably cruel punishment would await us were I, were we, to refuse, for
    the manifold signatures, stamps, seals, and even the very paper they are found on makes the
    progeny of the bearer of our bleak fate manifestly clear beyond any doubt, the latter being,
    in the form of a letter:<br>
    <br>
    "You are to launch an expedition into the Pale in order to ascertain<br>
    <br>
    Signed:<br>
    High Commissioner José Francisco de Azevedo e Silva<br>
    Commonwealth of the Pale<br>
    13 August 1911"<br>
    <br>
    I did not dare respond to this letter humbly asking for clarification, for orders of this sort
    are to be obeyed without question, to the letter indeed, no matter how meaningless they may
    appear to be. Rumours have it, many indeed confirmed, others less so, that every now and then,
    orders of this sort descend upon the unsuspecting like sudden calamities whom are afterwards
    never heard of again and soon forgotten, perhaps out of sheer fright: at one point, it was
    ordered that everything and everyone that exists be accounted for in order to then substract
    therefrom everything and everyone that is not so as to obtain an accounting of nothing, and
    then, it was ordered that a map be drawn that encompassed itself and as such, all other maps
    that were encompassed by the space it was to occupy in order to thereby locate a, supposedly,
    most obstinately obscure hole in the very fabric of reality that defied location. And now,
    this. And along with the letter, an orb of no apparent use or value with a handwritten, or
    rather scribbled, badly, note attached to it stating plainly: "MAVIGATIONAL AIDE. PALACE IN
    CENTRE OF GOAT." - which is, of course, most helpful.<br>
    <br>
    As much as little there is to say concerning our ostensible destination. All know the meaning of
    the idiom "the Pale" and the only very gradually vanishing echoes of tradition passed on since
    antediluvian times that constitute therefrom, or from there, depending on one's perspective on
    the inextricable web of notion and reality, an actual place, places of all places, and so on,
    of rather more metaphysical a nature, as in the expression of profound astonishment, taking
    its origin in some long-forgotten poem:<br>
    <p>

    <p class="text-green text-centre">
    Beyond the Pale she cast her eyes<br>
    and there she saw<br>
    a thousand things.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Over the centuries, much more that has been composed that is of any note concerning the Pale
    has been lost than remains extant in our day and age. The Pale, the Nothing, the Great Void,
    the Silence Unseen That Sees, End without End, Erṣetu lā tāri, Kurnugū, and countless
    others. The subject recurs incessantly across our history, only to wane in vain time after time
    after the inevitable collapse of the lofty towers of its rigorous reckoning, for its object
    unceasingly continues to defy all attempts to conceive it. The traces and trails of countless
    theories, models, accounts, and so on and so forth, thereof now line the speech of the Sea
    Peoples and their vivid imagination. There are, of course, people that claim to have traversed
    the Pale and brought through it luxurious goods of great value and priceless delicacies from
    regions and places none have heard of but upon further enquiry it would turn out that they
    have no memory of any such place nor how they came to be where they were. Some thus say that
    the Pale, as tradition holds it, is the place of all places, the place between places, where
    the very boundaries of being and non-being meet, and beyond. Others say that the Pale is the
    demesne of dreams and imagination, the well-spring of our very souls, where everything begins
    and everything ends; of obscure relation, in ancient Babylonia, the Pale was, supposedly, known
    as Mātnaḫármuṭ, the Vanishing Lands, although this may be apocryphal. And then some say
    that if one says that something is or lies "beyond the Pale", it cannot be found or retrieved
    until one has entirely extinguished the very thought of it within themselves. And lastly, others
    say that none of this is true, or at least that inasmuch as it may be true, it is irrelevant,
    and that the Pale is simply death itself, nothingness, inexistence, and to avoid it at all cost,
    wherever one should find it. Of course, curiously, perhaps merely when what is commonly held to
    be true is apprehended by the discerning eye to discern what is right in front of it, everyone
    knows how to go there, giving a literal meaning to the expression "they set sail towards the
    Pale of their days". Although this is taken as manifestly clear and mundane as the sun in the
    sky and the sea below, it seems to have been, thus far, virtually entirely ignored by all those
    great, many people we know of that have attempted to study the nature of the Pale. All one has
    to do is to set sail towards no particular direction - as long as it be towards the horizon -
    until "all-surrounding nothingness" encompasses "the fading, fading eyes" - as tradition holds,
    for none would be as foolish to do so.<br>
    <br>
    And thus, it would appear, our expedition into the Pale in order to ascertain, whatever it is there
    may or may not be to ascertain, shall commence on this day, 19 August 1913 at 05:00 in the morning.

    <p class="text-red">
    Suddenly, she felt very, very tired. She inexplicably felt compelled to place her palm upon the
    orb and as she did so, she felt as though an ineffable imprint of herself was left therein,
    slowly but surely growing from a mere simulacrum into a being independently existing of her,
    saved sound and safe from whatever harm could possibly come to her in this world, however many
    other worlds there may be.  She continued to feel very, very tired. She resolved to seek out sleep
    in great measure and found it too, for a while.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="text-black">
    The darkest sun of merciful sleep dawned, arose, and drew into its shroud of soothing extinction
    all that lay beneath. Her breathing slowed. The weight of the world at first was uncomfortably upon
    her but then vanished. Sleep, the little death. She first faded and waned and then disappeared
    altogether. Not a single thought nor memory remained, for wherever things perish is where all
    things arise, and none may venture there, and whatever therein dwells then departs to later
    return. Sleep, the unknowable genesis of life itself. She drifted further and further into the
    depths of the unfathomable well that constituted the unchartered lands of her conditions of
    possibility. All the contradictions that had entailed her existence by and by were sublated
    and thus she commenced to dream.<br>
    <br>
    Trails and traces of fragments of memories, some mesmerising, some of no greater meaning, flowed
    forth amidst the capricious streams that at times merged into and then separated out and away
    out of the nameless great, deep abyss beneath the surface of the manifest and apparent, where
    everything arranged itself into what it was to become. Narratives, stories untold, encounters,
    conclusions, and questions therein mingled freely and occasionally engendered the outright
    bizarre and absurd, to then pass away and find their rightful place and shape and form in some
    crevice of her consciousness, for later retrieval. And a great deal thereof there was, for she
    had not properly slept and dreamt in what seemed like years. The shadows of what had lain right
    in front of her all along appeared and darkness was upon her. Something changed.<br>
    <br>
    In a shadowy mirror within a mirror, reflected therein, an unidentifiable silhouette clad in
    gleaming green radiant, bright shining splendour of awfully divine Melammu there was bearing an
    orb, the sight of which made her flesh creep in all-encompassing, primal fear and trembling. She
    felt compelled to scream but she had no mouth to scream with. Suddenly, the fragmented pair of
    phrases that had imprinted itself on her subconscious emerged into her immense consciousness
    possessed of torment:
    </p>

    <p class="text-green text-centre">
    all-surrounding nothingness<br>
    the fading, fading eyes
    </p>

    <p class="text-black">
    The innumerable mirrors broke into uncountable shards and each shard burst forth into an endlessly
    cascading cacophony of endlessly reflected boundlessness and what remained of the emptiness
    surrounding it, had become a silent sea of terrifyingly recursive infinity. Everywhere that was
    somewhere beheld more of itself without end, broken up and shattered into smaller and smaller
    pieces, that maddeningly begat more of the same, so much that her immense consciousness was
    assailed by the totality of all existence multiplied by itself, then exponentiated, tetrated, and
    pentated until space and time were no more. Then, nothing but the Void that was not remained. The
    terrifying silhouette had disappeared along with the orb.<br>
    <br>
    The orb was within her.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="text-red">
    She abruptly awoke, drenched in sweat and the suffocating aura of unspeakable terror that knows
    no name.
    <br>
    Multiple days and nights had passed. Somehow.
    <br>
    The orb was gone.<br>
    <br>
    It was time to leave. At once. Towards: anywhere, that was not here.<br>
    She resentfully took a shower, dressed unceremoniously, assembled a reasonably arbitrary but largely
    useful assemblage of items, stowed them away safely inside her most obsequious purse, put on her
    most unexacting jacket and an undemanding, warm woolly hat too that provided a measure of comfort,
    deemed her hastily assembled outfit to be fit for the purpose of communicating to her now forbidding
    abode that after all these years, and what have you, well, numerous initially cordial and courteous
    things one is to say to one another that soon turn sourly stern and then eventually descend into
    exchanges of condescending insults shouted rather too loudly and, oh, well, would you please just
    sod off and never talk to me again. And, the obligatory slamming of the door, any door, perhaps all
    of them. Did she just tell her flat to sod off? So be it, she thought.<br>
    <br>
    And off she was.<br>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="text-green text-centre">
    Do not blame me for blame scarcely touches me<br>
    And guide me Lord, for I am lonely<br>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="text-red">
    Houses. Buildings. Places, objects. Most of them subtly altered, in the wrong places - or
    orientations - altogether. Neither of note nor of concern. Not anymore. Sod it all. To hell with it.
    Or, if proven impossible, let it all remain here. Not much of a difference, anyway. Not as far as
    she was concerned. The sky, the sun, the moon, and the vast firmament all resounded in agreement, or
    at least so it seemed. She had been here too long. Whichever place one dwells within for
    sufficiently long an amount of time, in time it also dwells within oneself. Ghosts, all around.
    Memories, fading traces thereof. The kind to leave behind and the kind that one is beset by when it
    is least expected. As if in a dissociated kind of trance, she was walking less so without than
    within, every step leading further and further into herself. Something waited for her somewhere, but
    it was not to be. Not yet. She passed past streets shrouded in nothingness but she did not notice.
    Dreams. A rare thing hardly encountered in way too long. Until last night. Did she pass from one
    dream into another, she pondered. Or perhaps, did the one lead to the other with both taking place
    in the same plane of existence? What if one were to stop dreaming and then to slowly cease to exist,
    anywhere?, her internal monologue plodded along.<br>
    <br>
    In Akkadian, a dream was referred to as Mašarrū, of unclear etymology; related to wind, perhaps?
    Possibly a locative noun. Or maybe not. And: Šittu: sleep - be it good or bad - Mušuttu -
    dream-ritual(?) - and also Šuttu: a dream, a reverie. Her new, previously long lost, demesne of
    preference. A truly ancient word, its origin dating back at least around 6000 years, with cognates
    in nearly all Semitic languages, reconstructed as *Šinat and *WVšVn- in Proto-Semitic. In Ugaritic:
    Šnt. Those pesky vowels. In Syriac and in Hebrew, respectively: Šentā and Šēnā. And in Arabic:
    Sunāt, of course - the original root - W-S-N - retained: Wasina-Yawsanu, Wasnan, inter alia,
    meaning: to sleep deeply, to slumber; to be stifled by the exhalations of a well; sloth; want;
    sleepy, and so on and so forth. Her mind had turned into a dictionary reaching back thousands of
    years and across the branches of space and time. In Arabic, a dream is referred to as Manām: a
    locative noun, the place of sleep. Dreams, the place of sleep. Or: Ḥulm or Ruʔyā. Both relating to
    things seen whilst in the state of sleep, whilst dreaming. A vision, something that is hoped or
    wished for. Etymologically related also to Ḥilm: self-possession, a quality much appreciated amongst
    Arabs and most sorely lacking in most. Dream-like reality. And: Karan. Sleep, slumber.
    Etymologically related to digging and particularly, a grave. Sleep, the little death.<br>
    <br>
    "I saw a ghostly shadow in my dreams / And I said: O vision, who has sent for me? / It said: she
    whom has known you has sent me, she, your certain desire, whom you waste away for in longing" - a
    poem on Sufism or worldly love, depending on one's point of view. Or he. Was this a vision? She
    suddenly thought:<br>
    </p>

    <p class="text-red text-centre">
    To dream with open eyes<br>
    is to see the world change<br>
    and in silence<br>
    the endless paths appear<br>
    </p>

    <p class="text-red">
    Her mind felt clear and her heart at ease. Perhaps this ought be written down somewhere, fixed, as
    it were, and then watered generously, so that it would grow into something pleasant. The faint scent
    of the Pacific Ocean lingered within her senses. What a pleasant dream. The Pacific Ocean. The
    origin of the Baltic Sea, enclosing many of the Northern European countries. The second-largest of
    the world's five oceans, separating the Old World from the New World. Yes. Of course.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly, her consciousness awoke into the world around her, having something of utmost importance
    to alert her to: that oddly unlocatable boutique, right in front of her! The Logbook! The orb! She
    was stood right in front of it, somehow. How could it be? - she wondered, suspended in absolute
    amazement and stunned by sheer improbability. Whatever you seek you shall find only once you have
    extinguished the very thought of it within yourself, she thought. Oh, to hell with the thoughts.
    Time for action.<br>
    <br>
    She entered the boutique and therein perceived words spoken in some language that sounded quite
    familiar to her which she promptly identified as, oddly enough, Old Ḥijāzi Arabic, a shower of words
    therein that just as promptly assailed her with much enthusiasm, most of which she actually did get,
    then came upon her:<br>
    <br>
    Family and plains, that she was most welcome, would she please have the kindness to condescend to
    come in, and would she like a cup of a beverage of something or two or three, and how was her
    family, and her health, and the health of her family, and the family of her health, and how was she
    indeed, and that should she lay her eye upon any object whatsoever at all within his most humble
    boutique then surely it would be upon his honour for her to take possession of it, upon which -
    after another hastily assembled assemblage of cordial formalities that would suffice in order not to
    invite offence - she did reply that yes, in fact, there may very well be such a thing, and that she
    was in fact looking for the remainder of an obscure "Logbook of the Expedition into the Pale" one
    part of which she thought to have bought in this very boutique and that she, unfortunately, did not
    appear to have any money which, apparently, as she rummaged through her purse turned out to be wrong
    for she was in possession of quite a bit of money, old Chilean pesos as it happened, but no mental
    resources were to be spent on this peculiarity, which was met with another shower of words and said
    object of her apprehension and that her command was upon his head, from his above, and out of his
    eyes and would that he could offer to her fortune and wealth as long as the fortress of Abū Kurayz
    and as tall and steadfast as Mountain ʕasīb then no joy greater than to serve her command could
    possibly be upon him but she was already on her way out, cushioned by numerous extemporaneously
    composed excuses that involved the grave, lethal even, illness of some distant relative that
    happened to live just around the corner and that it was her duty to attend to her every need for
    family is the world and off she was - yet not without bidding him farewell - without having caused
    anyone any amount of offence and in possession of her object of apprehension.<br>
    <br>
    With single-minded resolve, her mind sharply focussed on but one thing. She determined that her next
    task was to locate and rent a room with her newfound, conveniently so, wealth, with the prospect of
    having to convince someone that old Chilean pesos did in fact constitute legitimate currency as a
    secondary task that could surely be addressed by casting various showers of words of long, run-on
    sentences that seemed to go nowhere at whomever should attempt to prove an obstacle in her glorious
    path. As she dashed with the fierce facial expression of someone to whom the earth has become but
    the canvas upon which to cast their indefatigable will through and across people and places and
    streets, numerous thoughts of increasing urgency she successfully evaded, redirected, sent
    elsewhere, and eventually simply told to sod off and leave her alone appeared:<br>
    <br>
    The fact that she seemed to have somehow travelled at least 12.386 km in next to no amount of time,
    that she was wholly unprepared for such an unexpected and sudden voyage, that returning home was
    beginning to seem a fruitless endeavour - this, she did not mind, for there was nothing left for her
    there and she had no true intention to go there again nor did she, at this point, seem to feel that
    home was home and for the time being, she had no more home. Then, after some time spent asking
    around for a reasonable place, a residencial, to lodge in, the fact that all the newspapers seemed
    to be oddly specific about today's date: 18 August 1913, which was only off by a century and a
    decade too - which she brushed off by arguing that when all is said and done, time is but relative
    and fleeting, and doubly so Chilean time and Arab time even moreso. The fact that the Valparaíso of
    her recollection did not, in fact, have 77 mountains rather than 42, and that usually, the Pacific
    Ocean was, in fact, located to the West and the mountains to the East and not, as would appear to be
    the case, the other way around - this thought she decided to simply intimidate, interrogate, and
    then lock up in some squalid prison somewhere hidden away within her subconscious so that it would
    not continue to harass her. And lastly, the rather more severe and most urgent thought that
    something was very, very seriously wrong. This thought she pretended to actually take seriously and
    give due consideration and she promised to it that she would revisit it after having found a
    residencial to lodge in, which proved to be of sufficient distraction to the thought to allow for
    its unsuspected assassination.<br>
    <br>
    Calle de Azevedo e Silva #7, just past Plaza Echaurren. Residencial "Ni ahí". Perfect. Thought.
    Perfect. Charming, even. Just what she was looking for. The pinnacle of her accomplishments.
    Shelter, maybe some food, a cup of tea, and then the Logbook, and then rest. Maybe. A parrot greeted
    her with vulgar Chilean obscenities. Nothing could possibly stop her now. Her resolve was as
    steadfast as Mountain ʕasīb. Or something like that. In she marched, exuding enthusiasm of almost
    mortal proportions, then a brief - much, much briefer than earlier - exchange of formal cordialities
    and cordial formalities followed, followed by an exchange of money. To her surprise, no amount of
    words was required in order for her peculiarly out of date currency to be accepted - a quietly
    murmuring thought about something involving today's date resurged but she ignored it. Shortly after,
    she found herself inside her new home: four walls, none of which appeared to be missing or about to
    collapse on her, three inviting, structurally sound windows offering a beautiful vista of the
    Pacific Ocean to the East and the mountains to the West - a thought appeared and then disappeared
    again - lovably rustic but sturdy furniture, a very large and comfy bed, a desk, and a clock - that
    actually seemed to work and showed no signs of suddenly exploding. She breathed in and then out. She
    made it. All was taken care of. She was home.<br>
    <br>
    She sat down at the desk and began to - or rather, continue - to read from her most treasured
    possession: "Logbook of the Expedition into the Pale".<br>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
    Logbook of the Expedition into the Pale, ? ? 19??(?)<br>
    <br>
    It may or may not be any arbitrary day of any arbitrary month of some arbitrary year in the 20th
    century. Perhaps. Our expedition has, starting with an insurmountable sense of foreboding fright,
    gained the totality of all that which is subsumed by the words one habitually would describe
    cataclysmic catastrophes with. There is very little to do at all other than to cast upon the canvas
    of logbook entries towering words describing less and they but hardly serve to ward off
    all-encompassing terror. We have been gathered around the orb for a timespan that renders all
    mundane notions of time beyond meaning. Our eyes do not see nor do our ears hear except for what
    little the orb provides us with. There is nothing. There is neither space nor is there time beyond
    the confines of our grim shelter.  Only a faint echo reverberating within the shadows of our souls
    remains in the reflection of the orb. Rarely, the outlines of what then appear to be figments of our
    respective others bodily presences are carved into my peripheral vision but they fade, fade, fade
    and pass away. Everything is but passing. There is nothing and it does not end.<br>
    <br>
    I am now reminded, for as long as any memories remain, for I fear that as soon as any of my
    memories are invoked, they also fade away, by the haunting, humble song of the Sea Peoples in peril
    that now with much discernment describe our predicament:<br>
    </p>

    <p class="text-green text-centre">

    abandon your aim,<br>
    for none may return<br>

    ...and then she abruptly fell into deep sleep.<br>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="text-black">
    Darkness descended. Beyond the boundary of the infinitessimal unknowable unknown, beyond the primal
    effervescence of uncertainty, beyond what gravitation condemned, there dwelt the Void that was
    not, in silently serene, all-crushing all-destroying impossibility of endless infinity. There
    was nothing. As awareness ascended, she departed from her senses and in annihilation became
    extinguished. There was nothing and within the nothingness, beginning came to end and ending
    was unknown, and thus she began to see without seeing and to hear without hearing and to be
    without being.<br>
    She was within the Pale, she had become the Pale, the Pale had become her, and there was nothing but
    the Pale.
    </p>

    <p class="text-green text-centre">
    Beyond the Pale she cast her eyes<br>
    and there she saw<br>
    a thousand things.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="text-black">
    As she opened her eyes within, she crossed a planet transformed. The world was rebuilt. Tens
    of thousands of incomprehensible roads led to tens of thousands of incomprehensible places
    that contained tens of thousands of more roads and places and places and roads. The Endless
    Paths were upon her. Saturn rose high in the sky above her, slowly eclipsing gradually melting
    clouds of hauntingly unfamiliar shapes with a vast ocean beneath. Bountiful question mark-shaped
    birds flew past her towards the horizon, placidly carrying forth and away the questions to
    her innermost answers in perpetuity. She felt at peace even though she knew not why. For a
    singular moment beyond time and space, everything ceased to be and then began anew. The world
    had changed. Everything was different. Her right hand bore an orb broken and renewedly recast,
    her very essence therein was forever to dwell.<br>
    <br>
    She had taken from the Nothing what was not within it

    and thus she awoke anew. Bizarre, lucid dreams appeared to have become her new nocturnal companion.
    For now, it did not matter.<br>
    A new day. 19 August 1913, a thought proudly declared somewhere within her nascent consciousness.<br>
    The clock read 5:00 AM.<br>
    First: food, then more Logbook.<br>
    <br>
    It was still dark.<br>
    She was hungry. And disoriented.<br>
    No matter, she thought, she had work to do. All else was of no relevance now.<br>
    <br>
    The Logbook lay ahead, bathed in peculiarly gloomy, green radiance. She got out of bed and sat down
    by the desk, though she could hardly tell either objects were there at all.<br>
    Only one single tattered page remained for her to read - she sighed, but then reassured herself that
    surely this was to lead to something of even greater importance. To her surprise, this one last page
    was composed in badly and disturbingly scribbled - or hastily carved? - Old Sumerian cuneiform - a
    language and script that she was familiar with to only a certain degree, a scholar she certainly was
    not, though driven by her unrelenting resolve she felt up to the task at hand. A great deal of
    effort it took for her to decipher the fragmentary speech that seemed to almost address her, her in
    person, directly, and much of it was beyond her comprehension yet in the end she succeeded and thus
    she read:<br>

    <p class="text-red">
    Something changed. Countless thoughts previously given no attention that seemed to be totally
    unrelated to each other assumed just the right shapes and quietly arranged themselves into something
    coherent that turned her mind upside down and inside out like some sort of deranged kaleidoscope.
    Awareness ascended. Vast, boundless terror was upon her and within her, for now she knew whom she
    was.<br>
    She began to cry and tear-sized, liquid orbs flowed from her eyes into the infinite abyss all around
    her.<br>
    <br>
    One path only was left to speak of.<br>
    Beginning arose aflame and ending became known.<br>

    <p class="text-red text-centre">
    In all-surrounding nothingness,<br>
    the darkness of the Pale<br>

    In a long, forlorn longboat<br>
