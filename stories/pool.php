    Her daily ritual called for the obligatory recording of the daily events in her
    journal. She was sat on the floor on a pile of comforting pillows. She seized her
    reed pen, the paper, the empty canvas she was to cast words upon, lay waiting in
    front of her. She attempted to gather the turmoil of her thoughts into a coherent
    stream of words. After a moment, she had to admit that she had little recollection
    of what had indeed transpired on this particular day that had not already the day
    preceding this day, or that day, or any other. Time had become the stream from which
    her dreams travelled gently into her days and thence returned. Only fading memories
    remained in the distance as though mirages in some desert.<br>
    <br>
    She arose. As she was stood, she idly cast a glance or two across the room into the
    small window adorned with delicately crafted woodwork. She decided to leave.<br>
    <br>
    Although it had not rained in a great while, outside in the courtyard there stood, in
    the shade of a palm tree, a pool replenished by some remote source. Suddenly, she
    felt very, very tired and worn out, as if the fraying tapestry of her very being
    began to surrender to the indefatigable will of time and age. Her task, her mission,
    of supreme and utmost importance, or so she had been told, as it would appear, had
    at no point surrendered very much in the way of good sense. Sometimes she thought
    that she had little reason to continue holding on to it but she did nonetheless, for
    reasons she did not dare delving into. Not that the matter at hand was difficult or
    complicated. It was, in fact, very simple. She sighed. She retrieved with monotonous
    obeisance, rendered to an unspecific entity, from her comforting robe the letter
    bearing all the official seals and signature, in their correct places and manners of
    placing, required in order to vest it in authority due. Then, ceremoniously, she bore
    the letter in her hands and read:<br>
    <br>
    "You are to, at once, repair to the village by the name of (illegible) in the
    province of (illegible) in order to ascertain"<br>
    <br>
    Signed:<br>
    High Commissioner José Francisco de Azevedo e Silva<br>
    Commonwealth of the Pale<br>
    13 August 1911"<br>
    <br>
    As she had come to notice, there was little to ascertain, or to ascertain the
    particular objects of ascertainment thereof, or whether there was anything to
    ascertain at all, or what, or why, or, for that matter, where, if anywhere at all,
    she was.
    <br>
    Not that there was, as such, nothing. In fact, there was a great deal of what was
    clearly not nothing in the slightest. If only for its peculiarly persistent refusal
    to subject itself to being recorded or even regarded with any reasonable amount of
    consistency: what was at once there and appeared to be such and such, the next
    week, or morning at times, or even a half-day later, was either no longer there at
    all, or rearranged sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically, or replaced with
    something entirely unexpected. A singular pillar of ancient, antediluvian even,
    appearance, stood upon a hill with majestic stature surrounded by a patch of white
    lilies in an odd hexagonal pattern that bore, at first, cuneiform she could not
    manage to decipher and then, Ancient South Arabian she equally failed at deciphering,
    and eventually, an appendix of the "Book of the Misers" by al-Jāḥiẓ containing 9th
    century Baṣran cooking recipes that, after 3 weeks, turned into a monumentally
    humongous spear, piercing the occasionally appearing cloud, surrounded by a patch of
    smaller spear-flowers, each bearing miniscule spears on its spear-shaped petals,
    surrounded by spear-shaped bees busily casting spear-shaped appendages at it. A door
    that, for almost one half-year, most stubbornly refused to offer any means, no matter
    how much creativity and persistence was invested into this task, to open it, lay open
    the day after the half-year had passed to then lead to the same door in a completely
    different village that was, for some reason, entirely bereft of any other doors and
    of sunlight, perpetually bathed in treacherous moonlight. Seemingly endless paths,
    streets, alleys, roads, trails, and stairways that although led hither and thither,
    turned more absurd and bizarre the further one should choose to explore them, until
    their geometry assumed such grotesque nature that all volition to entertain this
    whole trail of thought vanished and, as soon as this had become manifestly clear,
    vanished themselves only to be replaced by a map thereof that now no longer referred
    to any territory except for its own. A hudhud bird that sang words in old Andalusian
    metres from which more hudhud birds emerged which busily drew trees made of letters
    in old Andalusian script of impressive calligraphic qualities where more hudhud birds
    then hatched until nightfall, at which point they all feasted upon the letters and
    words of their creation, only to then repeat this process, ad infinitum, the next day
    by the coming of dawn.<br>
    <br>
    Page after page after page - the fact that she was evidently in possession of an
    infinite number of pages and reed pens no longer bothered her nor where they came
    from - of endless phenomena of this sort, or these sorts, for at first she had
    attempted to subject the same to rigorous phenomenology, a futile task that soon
    faded into the infinity of the Pale. The more of it there was, the less of her there
    seemed to be.<br>
    <br>
    An inexplicably haunting atmosphere of the uncertain and ineffable surrounded her.
    The pool by the palm tree that was now her pleasant refuge from the midday sun had,
    almost certainly, not been there last night. Nor the courtyard nor her very room,
    although phenomena of this sort had curiously ceased to induce anything but
    indifference within her since soon after her arrival. Her arrival. She could hardly
    remember having been anywhere else, for where she was, was anywhere and everywhere at
    all times, it seemed. None of the inhabitants of the village she had spoken to seemed
    to take note of this either. Were it not for her obligation to record the daily
    events in her day, she surely would have become one of them as well: fading in and
    out of existence, going from the furthest place to the most distant time, formless
    and free.<br>
    <br>
    On what she had now, for unspecific reasons, ascertained to be the 777th day, the
    calmness of clarity descended upon her. Everything, finally, made sense. She went
    back upstairs to record her last journal entry and then left the village by
    descending into the pool towards its remote source, towards the remote outskirts of
    wherever it was she was spoken of to later, in a week, arrive at her destination, the
    planet of Venus. Perhaps.

    <p class="text-green">
    "After 777 days, I have, with supreme and utmost certainty, ascertained that this
    village does not exist. Nor, by all appearances, do I."
