      <h2 class="text-centre">General: counterindications/adverse interactions</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Any medication or substance in general which is metabolised by the enzyme <strong>Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)</strong>
          and of which, after taking into account bioavailability, average concentrations in serum in the µg/mL range
          are attained, such as <strong>Quetiapine IM and XR (Seroquel, etc.,)</strong> will interact with Oestradiol
          by significantly increasing serum levels relative to the same amount thereof if no Quetiapine were present
          and simultaneously, significantly lower levels of Quetiapine are also induced. This must be taken into
          account when titrating upwards or downwards either Oestradiol or the medication in question or both as well
          as when estimating target serum levels relative to any HRT dosage.<br>
          <br>
          This occurs both due to competition for the same enzyme by both Oestradiol and Quetiapine as well a
          difference in average concentrations of close to two orders of magnitude: in the case of Oestradiol, 100-200
          pg/mL vs. in the case of Quetiapine, ~1-10 µg/mL given dosages of 100-350 mg p/d and an oral bioavailability
          of 9%.<br>
          <br>
          While this phenomenon is acknowledged and discussed in literature<a href="#r1" class="a-reference">[1]</a>,
          it is not sufficiently well-known and particularly so in conjunction with HRT.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any medication or substance in general which significantly increases SHBG, be it in the short, if acutely,
          mid, or long term, given habitual use, is to be ideally avoided entirely or at least treated with great care,
          particularly when stability in HRT has not been attained, as this will affect Free Oestradiol and constitute
          significant endocrine disruption. This includes, most importantly, <strong>Alcohol</strong><a href="#r2" class="a-reference">[2]</a>,
          especially if acutely, and, though to a much lesser degree and indirectly,
          <strong><span class="text-line-through">Caffeine</span> Coffee</strong><a href="#r3" class="a-reference">[3]</a>.
          As Insulin increases SHBG also, there is an argument to be made that a healthy diet devoid in particular of
          "junk food", etc. is ideally to be preferred.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-centre">General: Oestradiol cycles</h2>

      <p>
        It bears mentioning that exogenously driven Oestradiol 35-day cycles with distinguished pseudo-follicular, pseudo-ovulatory
        peak, pseudo-luteal, as well as PMS/PMDD phases exist, as observed by the author of this document and in the form of a pervasive
        pattern in a sufficiently large amount of anecdotal evidence on Reddit, etc. The mechanism behind this is unknown though it would
        appear likely that the culprit is to be found in the emergent dynamics resulting from interactions between Oestradiol levels/curves
        and (inter alia) Oestrogen Receptor (ER) populations (density) as well as their sensitivity and the housekeeping thereof (e.g. enzymes)
        within each cell, being as Oestradiol is responsible in conjunction with ERs for making more ERs, constituting an autoregulatory
        feedback loop exhibiting hysteresis within a larger intracellular regulatory network with considerable inertia, see, inter alia,
        <a href="#r4" class="a-reference">[4]</a>, <a href="#r7" class="a-reference">[7]</a>, and the
        <a href="#temporary-discontinuation">temporary discontinuation</a> section in this document.<br>
        <br>
        As observed by the author of this document, there exists a constraint on rate of change that is lower than 200% given any
        average concentration, e.g. an increase from 50 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL (e.g. +50 pg/mL) is excessive and will dangerously impact
        cycle structure; being as the constraint in endogenous puberty is +~1-3 pg/mL per cycle, it is likely to be significantly
        lower than 200%.<br>
        <br>
        In case of sufficient, especially pervasive, damage to cycle structure and subsequent recovery of stable Oestradiol inputs wrt.
        average serum levels as well as concentration curves, cycles may either temporarily lose coherence (highly pathological) and/or
        degrade to a cycle length of 7 days (equally pathological) for, on average, at least 7 iterations (e.g.  7 weeks,) followed, most
        likely, by an increase to a cycle length of 14 days (pathological, but much less problematic) for up to 2 iterations (e.g. 4 weeks
        in total,) and then recovery, back to the original (non-pathological) cycle length of 35 days. In case of failure to recover stable
        Oestradiol inputs, this process will continue oscillating indefinitely and maladaptively entrain these erratic patterns and eventually
        go on to adversely affect downstream systems, such as the thyroid gland and require, as soon as possible,
        <a href="#temporary-discontinuation">temporary discontinuation</a>.

      <h2 class="text-centre">General: bloodwork pre-HRT; normal total T and high SHBG pre-HRT</h2>

      <p>
        When starting HRT, it is very highly recommended - in general - that extensive blood testing be done in order to determine a
        long list of serum levels, representing the pre-HRT state, and particularly including total E2 and total T as well as
        SHBG.<br>
        A consistently high SHBG pre-HRT that is not accounted for by diet, lifestyle, medication, etc. in conjunction with normal T
        as well as, most likely, barrage of pervasive, (adult) life-long physiological as well as mental symptoms, may be indicative
        of partial Androgen Receptor Insensitivity, as T is supposed to downregulate hepatic SHBG expression; this can be tested for.

      <h2 class="text-centre">Transdermal Oestradiol gel: 1.28g pumps vs. 1.25g</h2>

      <p>
        An unnamed brand of transdermal Oestradiol gel is claimed by the manufacturer to produce 1.25g of gel upon pump activation.
        This is not the case, as anyone with a digital scale may confirm for themselves. Instead, 1 pump corresponds to ~1.28g of
        gel with fluctuation in the µg range. This must be taken into consideration when estimating how many pumps a single bottle
        contains, after substracting the very first "priming" pump.<br>
        <br>
        It is advised to integrate weighing the bottle after priming and after each pump with a suitable digital scale into one's
        personal HRT protocol.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-centre">Transdermal Oestradiol gel: use pump gently</h2>

      <p>
        An unnamed brand of transdermal Oestradiol gel presents with an undocumented problem concerning its pump mechanism. If the
        pump mechanism is engaged with excessive force as opposed to gently, it will, given 2 pumps p/d, predictably and reliably
        break after about 21 days/3 weeks, at which point each pump will exceed 1.28g by a steadily increasing amount, as anyone with
        a digital scale may confirm for themselves.<br>
        <br>
        It is advised to integrate weighing the bottle after priming and after each pump with a suitable digital scale into one's
        personal HRT protocol.

      </h3>

      <p>
        As seen above, transdermal Oestradiol gel of whichever brand or manufacturer will generally present with a concentration
        curve across time as opposed to (ignoring brief peaks) stable levels, such as is the case with oral Oestradiol. This must be
        taken into consideration when attempting to determine serum levels as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Assay <strong>Cmax</strong>, e.g. the maximum or peak concentration at the <strong>3 hour mark</strong>
          (Tmax.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Assay <strong>Cmin</strong>, e.g. the minimum or trough concentration at the <strong>12 hour mark</strong>
          (Tmin,) e.g. right before the next dose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculate <strong>Cmean</strong>, e.g. the average concentration, by, based on <strong>Cmax</strong>,
          <strong>Tmax</strong>, <strong>Cmin</strong>, <strong>Tmin</strong>, finding the Area Under the Curve
          (AUC,)<a href="#r6" class="a-reference">[6]</a> utilising the logarithmic method (((c1 - c2) /
          (LN(c1) - LN(c2))) * (t2 - t1)) during the absorption phase (rising levels) and the linear method (1/2 * (c1
          + c2) * (t2 - t1)) during the elimination phase (falling levels.) This yields the maximum total exposure
          during that time period which, when divided by that same time period, e.g. 24 hours, will yield the maximum
          average concentration.<br>
          This is the most meaningful and important of the three pharmacokinetic parameters. Unless otherwise
          specified, any source specifying Oestradiol serum levels will refer to average concentration (Cmean.)<br>
          <br>
          A <a href="https://www.luciaillanes.de/de/etc/hrtauccalc">HRT AUC calculator</a> is available on this
          website.

      </h3>

      <p>
        As seen above, transdermal Oestradiol gel of whichever brand or manufacturer will generally present with a concentration
        curve with a considerable peak-to-trough ratio and two peaks and two troughs p/d. It bears mentioning that this can be
        suboptimal for the same reason as with the concentration curve of Oestradiol Valerate.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-centre" id="temporary-discontinuation">Transdermal Oestradiol gel: temporary discontinuation</h2>

      <p>
        When discontinuing, wait for between four to five weeks, taking cycle boundaries into account, before resuming and be mindful
        of both severely hypogonadic menopausal Oestradiol levels as well as, given insufficient Testosterone suppression, gradually
        rising Testosterone levels, though SHBG being slow to respond is helpful here, and, eventually, well into the 2nd month,
        hypothyroidism; being as there is no reservoir effect with transdermal Oestradiol gel, any Oestradiol remaining at trough,
        irrespective of time to steady state, will be gone within an hour at most, at which point endocrine Oestradiol will be strictly
        adrenal on the input side.<br>
        <br>
        With regard to the time period required to wait for, neither about two weeks (11.5 days: crashes after day 17.5) nor three
        weeks (18.5 days: crashes after week #5) are sufficient according to experimental evidence. It would appear probable that
        this is both a function of SHBG stability (steady state after max. 5 weeks) as well as compound ER state, e.g. ER population
        (density) in each cell as well as sensitivity and all factors relating to ER housekeeping from transcription/translation to
        activation and elimination and all factors significantly affected by (effective) Oestradiol.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, the presumed Oestradiol-driven ER density/sensitivity oscillations (cycles) appear to be only loosely coupled to
        their Oestradiol inputs and present with a considerable degree of hysteresis, e.g. they will maintain their internal state even
        if the external signal in its original state is absent for an unknown time period that may or may not correspond to between
        four-five weeks and may indeed be much longer, with the possibility of cycles gradually becoming more and more protracted, as
        observed in menopause and the phenomenon of cycles persisting after a hysterectomy.<br>
        <br>
        For a general overview that does not specifically focus on ERs, refer to <a href="#r7" class="a-reference">[7]</a>.
