<h1 style="text-align: center">Zamār atarḥáyyim amurrim rāšim libbíšu</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Lay of Atarḥáyyu the Amorite, the Hero</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center">IV</h3>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
He strode across shires and rivers spread wide<br>
He drove by the day and he drove by the night<br>
He rode towards roads that but fortune abide<br>
He sought without seeking, the Splendour his light<br>
But by moment and moment, the darkness grew nigh<br>
Emptiness empty, darkness on darkness, and sorrowful sky<br>
Atarḥáyyu, the Hero, in darkness he lay<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #7f0000; text-align: center">
"Atarḥáyyu! Draw near! Atarḥáyyu! Come here!"<br>
A voice in dreams deep, a voice did declare!<br>
But his eyes did not see, and his hands did not bear.<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
He went to the boundaries, of all, and beyond<br>
He moved silent in silence, from beginning to end<br>
He regarded the grace, in all, and grew fond<br>
He gazed upon death, to all to correspond<br>
But by moment and moment, hope faded his bond<br>
Emptiness empty, darkness on darkness, and sorrowful sky<br>
Atarḥáyyu, the Hero, in darkness he lay<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #7f0000; text-align: center">
"Atarḥáyyu! Come here! Atarḥáyyu! Have no fear!"<br>
A voice in dreams sunken, a voice did he hear!<br>
And he seized then his bow, an arrow, and spear.<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
He traversed the most joyful, Singing Forest Alālu<br>
He heard what the ear, nor the heart, may bear near<br>
He knew not the name, of fear nor of rue<br>
He stood by the Splendour, Baʕal Šadē, and Sīn too<br>
But by moment and moment, unfolding like dew<br>
Emptiness empty, darkness on darkness, and sorrowful sky<br>
Atarḥáyyu, the Hero, in darkness he lay<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #7f0000; text-align: center">
"Atarḥáyyu! Do listen! Atarḥáyyu! Pay heed!"<br>
A voice in dreams wavering, a voice and in need!<br>
But his ears did not hear, as he laid on his feet.<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
He reckoned the spiralling, Towers Arbāiu<br>
He laid eyes on the light, of stars upon stars<br>
He saw beauty, in light mirrored, anew and anew<br>
He stood by the Splendour, Baʕal Šadē, and Sīn too<br>
But by moment and moment, as time by time grew<br>
Emptiness empty, darkness on darkness, and sorrowful sky<br>
Atarḥáyyu, the Hero, in darkness he lay<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #7f0000; text-align: center">
"Atarḥáyyu! In darkness! Atarḥáyyu! Draw near!"<br>
A beast at last stood, a buffalo purple, whose voice he did hear!<br>
"Had you slain me and thus, a hunter you would have been,<br>
 but for you refrained, thus now I may declaim,<br>
 for all in Mātnaḫármuṭ, in its endlessless lain,<br>
 there is one that is older, and older than all,<br>
 there is one that is further, and further than all,<br>
 there is one that is wiser, Far-Away, and Remote,<br>
 Ūtnápištim his name, to whom Atarḥáyyu once came."<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
He passed into pages, of history and fame<br>
He set out to find, the Remote, Far-Away<br>
He was sewn into lay, and tales by his name<br>
When he found what to come, was to him all the same,<br>
for his tale could not end, for in darkness he lay,<br>
When winding words wrote, when darkness drew near,<br>
Atarḥáyyu, the Hero, to Ūtnápištim came<br>
</p>
