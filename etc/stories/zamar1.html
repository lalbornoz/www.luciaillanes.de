<h2 style="text-align: center">Lay of Atarḥáyyu the Hero</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center">I</h3>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
Once, there was a story<br />
in winding words lay written<br />
of all that was to end<br />
and emptiness appeared<br />
</p>

<p style="color: #7f0000; text-align: center">
When Atarḥáyyu rāš Libbíšu<br />
the Hero, the Possessor of his Heart,<br />
drew forth afore the Nothing<br />
set out to find a name<br />
on darkest trails of darkness<br />
for none he shall obtain<br />
<br />
He bore the noble Splendour<br />
and laid his arms to rest<br />
abandoned hope and gain<br />
nor time should him attain<br />
<br />
He cast aside his sight<br />
for naught he was to yearn<br />
when calmness reigned his eyes<br />
to emptiness he turned<br />
<br />
He rode a seven saroi<br />
and seven šār he rode<br />
on darkest trails of darkness<br />
his destiny he wrote<br />
<br />
He drove a road that went<br />
where beginning came to end<br />
where ending was unknown<br />
and all was drawn anew<br />
</p>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
Across lands spread far and wide<br />
the Splendour was his guide<br />
to mountains laid on high<br />
to the stars and to the sky<br />
he went but did not find<br />
<br />
Across rivers did he sail<br />
the Splendour his avail<br />
to the corners of the world<br />
to Šubartu, Martu, Elamtu, Šumer<br />
the weight of all he was to bear<br />
<br />
Across promontory and vale<br />
the Splendour cast his way<br />
to the Nothingness, the Pale<br />
to the darkness, to the Nothing<br />
a name he came to find<br />
</p>

<p style="color: #7f0000; text-align: center">
He drew forth afore the Pale<br />
set out to find a name<br />
to the Far-Away, Remote<br />
to Ūtnápištim he came<br />
<br />
A name he was to lend<br />
to Ningídumu, the Kindly,<br />
to Īnkuzén, the Golden-Eyed,<br />
when all was but to end<br />
<br />
To Ūtnápištim he came<br />
when all was but to end<br />
the Far-Away, Remote<br />
when naught there was of hope<br />
<br />
When Atarḥáyyu, the Hero<br />
drew forth to find a name<br />
may blessed be his hands<br />
may the Splendour be his countenance<br />
may calmness reign his eyes<br />
</p>

<p style="color: #007f5d; text-align: center">
Once, there was a story<br />
in silent signs concealed<br />
it drew itself anew<br />
and emptiness drew near<br />
</p>
