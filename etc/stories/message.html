It was still early in the morning, a cool breeze swept across the landscape outside.
There was still time. Consistency was very important. Without consistency, there
would be no pervasive pattern and no reason to lend thought to things one ought
indeed not lend anything to. The coded message patiently waited within the morning
cereal bowl. Soon, she would come downstairs and fill it with her favourite breakfast
cereal: Kellogg's Froot Loop Unicorns, no milk. And then stare at the cereal bowl
with suspicion. Consistency was very important. The sun shone warmly and birds had
earlier begun to sing. The usual morning routine. Nothing out of the ordinary. It
waited. And waited. Then, it waited. Whilst waiting.<br />

terrifyingly vast mind with forceful insistence. A cacophony of voices spoke directly
into its very soul, busily commenting on its innermost sensations. Terror was upon
it. It cried silent tears of despair. Nothing made sense anymore. It fled into what
seemed like a remote corner of what may at one point in time very well have
constituted her kitchen. Whoever she was. It was being watched. As all-encompassing
silence extended all around it, it quietly hid in its remote corner and incessantly

"...so, as per your latest blood tests, your testosterone is now down to 17 ng/dL and
your mean estradiol serum level is now around 175-200 pg/mL. How have you been
feeling?", the endocrinologist asked kade.<br />
<br />
"I wonder what became of all my voices and that? Are they okay?", kade asked.<br />
