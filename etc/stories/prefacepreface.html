<p>
Congratulations! You have dared many a trial and tribulation and everlasting success
was granted to you. You are now, most assuredly, reading the Preface to the Preface
of the Second Edition of BOOK.TXT. This is, most assuredly, of great benefit for this
is, most assuredly, impossible. You are, in fact, the first, and the last, person to
have, for the time being, acquired a copy of BOOK.TXT. But let us not get ahead of
ourselves, or afoot. A great many treasures and mysteries await, some of which are
sure to change your life forever. And the best part is: nobody has ever witnessed
them, nor shall anyone else ever witness them! And to add to that: BOOK.TXT has been
delicately crafted by the greatest and most skilled artisans of Eridu, Lagash, Kish,
Uruk, and fabled Dilmun utilising exclusively entirely biodegradable materials imbued
with magical qualities that prolong life and grant powers of prescience without
requiring access to a steady supply of Spice! Fortune is indeed smiling upon you and
her countenance bears splendour.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, recently passed trans-universal laws concerning entropic depletion
oblige us - and you - to present to you - and you to follow them - the following set
of rules, guidelines, observations, remarks, non sequuntur, notate bene, warnings,
curses, calumniations, predictions, and utterances under threat of imprisonment in
the Great Void, thus it is advised that you take them very, very seriously:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>
Please record your current average temperature in Kelvin. If you are devoid of
temperature, you do not in fact exist and it is obligatory that you immediately
desist from reading BOOK.TXT.
</li>
<li>
Please explicate in exhaustive detail an in exhausting number thereof the specific
reasons why you should continue to exist in your present spatio-temporal
configuration. Failure to do so may result in termination of existence.
</li>
<li>
Please record the number of neutrinos that you have interacted with at this
precise moment as well as the absolute universal time (AUT) for reference in, at
least, Planck Second resolution.
</li>
<li>
Please formulate at least seven (7) synthetic judgments a priori without recurring
to any kind of shady tricks such as invoking the Peano axioms or being deliberately
obtuse and droning on and on for an insufferably innumerable amount of words.
</li>
<li>
Please provide extensive documentation concerning your place and manner of
employment, favourite Quark colour charge, preferred angular momentum, and hidden
variable count for the time period commencing before your birth in Old Sumerian.
</li>
<li>
At this precise moment, there is a cat watching you intensely from an undisclosed
location. It is called Cat #394. Please do not disturb it. Its sole purpose is to
read your neural patterns in order to establish the constraints of cloning you.
</li>
<li>
Your shadow is now self-aware and may or may not respect the boundaries of its
incipient condition of being with respect to its unique relationship with you. Do not
under any circumstances attempt to abandon your shadow or erase it from existence.
</li>
<li>
Starting tomorrow somewhere around the dark tea-time of the soul, an exponentially
increasing number and quality of inexplicably puzzling and puzzlingly inexplicable
events will begin to alter your destiny. Please do be alarmed.
</li>
<li>
Do not under any circumstances attempt to use BOOK.TXT for any of the following
purposes: making an artificial black hole and/or Einstein-Rosen bridge, procuring
non-trivial amounts of non-abelian anyons, tricking c into thinking it's d or any
other letter but c in order to engage in FTL travel, figuring out how gravity
actually really does work, if at all, violate Heisenberg uncertainty, convert
baryonic matter into asymmetrical tube cat plushies, distort the shape of the
universe into obscene shapes, entice any number of neutrinos to engage in intrigue,
slander, conspiracy, lawsuits, threats and/or acts of violence, or any other such
malicious acts against any other number of neutrinos, irrespective of gang
membership.<br />
You may attempt to use BOOK.TXT to build a quantum computer or study string theory
because that's just silly.
</li>
</ol>
<br />
Be advised that, for reasons of the ongoing and unresolved problem of trans-universal
entropy depletion, after you have completed reading BOOK.TXT, you will cease to exist
and, in the process, contribute to trans-universal entropy decrease which will, of
course, exacerbate the aforementioned problem. This is entirely your fault. Your
possessions, personality, consciousness, and general state of being will subsequently
be replaced by BOOK.TXT.<br />
