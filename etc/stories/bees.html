In a valley serene and sumptuous laden with luxuriantly growing pastures and forests wide, known to
its many inhabitants as the Valley of Words, atop a large palm tree there lay a female hudhud bird. She
was most perplexed.  She blinked. Having done so, she blinked again but she remained perplexed. She had
only just dreamt of a word that that she had not heard before, which was, of course, most unheard of in
the Valley of Words. The sun rose and delivered warmth and light unto this particular district that the
hudhud bird called home. Ordinarily, at this time of day she would stretch her wings, clean her feathers,
and avail herself to her favourite morning time food in the area. But she was perplexed. She decided that
this matter ought be investigated with great diligence.
<br/>
<br/>
And so, she solemnly descended the lettered ladder leading to the bottom of the palm tree that had been
growing there since a few seasons ago. The occasional approximant and consonant gently strode towards
the ground, awaiting the coming of the rain, such that they would grow into colourful vocabulary. Having
alighted, she wondered which of her friends she ought consult with concerning the word that he had
heard. She was hungry, so she idly foraged and gathered a small number of sour semicolons and parenthesis
petals. Perhaps it is yet too early to bother whomever it should be with such great matters, she thought to
herself and decided to wander for a bit. As she did so, she remembered that she was perplexed. She breathed
in the refreshingly cool morning air. Miniscule drops of cuneiform dew sat on the leaves of the berry bushes
she had sampled her breakfast from, occasionally spelling out antediluvian Babylonian obscenities. Past
the berry bushes lay the Very Wordy Waterfall, who was still asleep, for it had endulged in an extended
nocturnal conversation with itself the night before. The hudhud bird usually appreciated its company,
its chattiness notwithstanding, but felt that, owing to its often overly conventional disposition,
it would surely not prove of much help in this matter. Who could possibly have heard of her word? As
she wandered without aim, she greeted the alphabet ants, assiduously carrying discarded diacritics and
excessive exclamation marks hither and thither, but they were too busy to notice her. Radiant rays of
sunlight illuminated the glade she was now stood in. Bountiful question mark birds began to sing their
enchanting songs, chanting questions forever unanswered. She raised her voice and addressed the Great
Alférez of the alphabet ants with reverence due saying: "Yâ Ayyuhâ l-Fârisu n-Nimâl!" and brought
unto him her concern and the source of her perplexity.  And as soon as she had done so, all the alphabet
ants suddenly stood still and the Great Alférez of the alphabet ants resoundingly declared unto her
that he had not once heard of any such word, not in any of the four corners of the world.

<br/>
She went towards the spider forest, anticipated by delicate, silken webs of syllables of often mystifying
prosodical patterns and curious signs that she did not recognise but assumed to be Paleohispanic.
She liked the spiders and was friends with them, or at least most of them, for some of them had turned
reclusive and academical, preferring the company of obscure ancient Omotic languages, connecting the
distant with the remote.  The morning sunlight dimmed and grew dull the deeper she ventured into the
spider forest and she grew attuned to the calming sounds the spiders produced around her. She ventured
further towards the Great Šâh-e-Bozorg, the king of the spider forest, to whose aid she had come on
numerous occasions. Surely, she thought to herself, he must have heard of this perplexing word and I may
come to find rest. As she stood afore the great king, she addressed him with reverence due saying: "Yâ
Ayyuhâ l-Mâliku l-ʕaẓīm!" and brought unto him her concern and the source of her perplexity. And
as soon as she had done so, all the nearby spiders suddenly stood still and the Great Šâh-e-Bozorg,
the king of the spider forest resoundingly declared unto her that he had not once heard of any such word,
not in any of the four corners of the world. She sighed.
<br/>
<br/>
She bid the great king and all of her spider friends farewell and departed towards the steppes of the
Learned Lion Labânum. Long and arduous was the trail that led there and by the time she arrived, the
midday sun stood high and desolate, leaving not a single cloud in the sky. By now, she was thirsty and
tired, but she persevered nonetheless.  She reached the Seven Soundless Spires, of which it was said
that every once in a while, the ineffable twists and turns of fate and fortune would grant upon the
unsuspecting traveller that should pass by them the gift of infinite hearing, by which their very hearts
would witness all that is sound that had ever been uttered or produced in an instant and experience bliss
and felicity. She paid them no mind. She reached the Seven Steles of Wisdom, where all that was wisdom
and all that sublime had been meticulously recorded by the disciples of the Learned Lion Labânum. She
paid them no mind. Instead, she continued towards the Rocky Promontory, where he was sat and meditated
on being and nothingness, occasionally uttering cryptic phrases that would then be recorded by his
disciples. She addressed him with reverence due saying: "Yâ Ayyuhâ l-Layṯu l-Ḥakīm!" and brought
unto him her concern and the source of her perplexity. And as soon as she had done so, all his disciples
suddenly stood still and the Learned Lion Labânum roared and then resoundingly declared unto her that
he had not once heard of any such word, not in any of the four corners of the world.
<br/>
<br/>
She sat and ate together with the disciples of the Learned Lion Labânum, who furnished her with
delicious pastries of pronouns adorned with ornate orthography, rare word salad, and surprisingly nourishing
stuffed vowels. Afterwards, they sat by the fire together and joyously recounted the many strange events
that had transpired in the steppes, endulging in captivatingly coloured liquors of fermented phonemes
that cast a smile upon the lips and perfumed the mouth. As the night bid the day farewell, she bid them
farewell as well fondly yet with naught of regret, for her indefatigable will to resolve the conundrum
she had chanced upon had but grown and she was resolved to seek past the very boundaries of the land,
should she have to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
She left towards the four corners of the world without aim anew. She walked and she walked, into the
distance ahead, she walked and she walked, and further and further, she walked and she walked, until
nowhere she was. Time seemed to lose meaning. She had no notion of where she was and even the moonlight
became scant, as she wrote her will upon the path of her footsteps. There was no more any light nor
did she perceive a singular sound. Perfect darkness and all-encompassing silence surrounded her. And
when her determination almost began to wane, suddenly the darkness gave way to light and the silence
gave way to monumentally large words written, drawn, and pronounced upon the canvas she was now stood
upon. She stopped and looked upon the words and was immediately filled with a sense of awe and delight,
for she had neither seen nor heard a great many of them! The burden of what her quest had demanded of
her turned light and she forgot why she had come here in the first place. She cheerfully jumped from
word to word, excitedly singing them into a song and her face grew radiant. But as she did so, she
remembered the word that she had heard of that was unheard of to all and the reason she had come here
to begin with.  Past the paragraph she was presently stood in, there lay a fading boundary, like the
fraying edges of a page. She calmed herself down and decided to pass past the boundary, steadfast in
her resolve to find her word.
<br/>
<br/>
She ceased to exist.
