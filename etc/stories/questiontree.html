Announcing the arrival of a calamitous morning, the owl of unasking quietly displaced the emptiness
of the night and within its wake awoke the dawn of uncertainty. It knew neither whence it had come
nor where its telos was to lie, merely that it possessed to each answer the question, for the eye
that beholds the darkness of the night sleeps not. And thus, wherever it went, hence became and came
to be. By the time the owl of unasking was no longer to be heard of or seen, a sprawling, wide
forest of words had grown within the emptiness it had displaced. Entirely enclosed within itself,

when time itself became immemorial and rendered the unlikely inevitable, the owl of unasking
returned and but briefly perceived the peculiar event and suddenly spoke, but noone was there to
hear its marvellous speech. And hence, they were never heard of again, cast and banished into
ephemeral eternality and impossible possibility.

blind shadow spoke and, shortly afterwards, continued: "They have not been seen anywhere."

The silent lion did not respond.

<p>
As dawn finally arrived, the hudhud bird spoke: "They seem to have vanished without a trace...", it
said, paused, then resumed in resignation: "...and along with them, the very reason that had
compelled them to leave..
