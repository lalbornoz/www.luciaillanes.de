<h2 style="text-align: center">General: counterindications/adverse interactions</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		Any medication or substance in general which is metabolised by the enzyme <strong>Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)</strong>
		and of which, after taking into account bioavailability, average concentrations in serum in the µg/mL range
		are attained, such as <strong>Quetiapine IM and XR (Seroquel, etc.,)</strong> will interact with Oestradiol
		by significantly increasing serum levels relative to the same amount thereof if no Quetiapine were present
		and simultaneously, significantly lower levels of Quetiapine are also induced. This must be taken into
		account when titrating upwards or downwards either Oestradiol or the medication in question or both as well
		as when estimating target serum levels relative to any HRT dosage.<br>
		<br>
		This occurs both due to competition for the same enzyme by both Oestradiol and Quetiapine as well a
		difference in average concentrations of close to two orders of magnitude: in the case of Oestradiol, 100-200
		pg/mL vs. in the case of Quetiapine, ~1-10 µg/mL given dosages of 100-350 mg p/d and an oral bioavailability
		of 9%.<br>
		<br>
		While this phenomenon is acknowledged and discussed in literature<a href="#r1" style="font-size: small">[1]</a>,
		it is not sufficiently well-known and particularly so in conjunction with HRT.
	</li>
	<li>
		Any medication or substance in general which significantly increases SHBG, be it in the short, if acutely,
		mid, or long term, given habitual use, is to be ideally avoided entirely or at least treated with great care,
		particularly when stability in HRT has not been attained, as this will affect Free Oestradiol and constitute
		significant endocrine disruption. This includes, most importantly, <strong>Alcohol</strong><a href="#r2" style="font-size: small">[2]</a>,
		especially if acutely, and, though to a much lesser degree and indirectly, <strong>Caffeine</strong><a href="#r3" style="font-size: small">[3]</a>.
		As Insulin increases SHBG also, there is an argument to be made that a healthy diet devoid in particular of
		"junk food", etc. is ideally to be preferred.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center">General: Oestradiol cycles</h2>

<p>
It bears mentioning that exogenously driven Oestradiol cycles exist, as observed by the author of this document and in the
form of a pervasive pattern in a sufficiently large amount of anecdotal evidence on Reddit, etc. The mechanism behind this is
unknown though it would appear likely that the culprit is to be found in the above mentioned ER dynamics as well as ER
housekeeping within each cell, being as Oestradiol is responsible in conjunction with ERs for making more ERs, constituting a
feedback loop internal to each cell, see, inter alia, <a href="#r4" style="font-size: small">[4]</a>.<br>
As observed by the author of this document, there exists a constraint on rate of change that is lower than 200% given any
average concentration, e.g. an increase from 50 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL (e.g. +50 pg/mL) is excessive and will dangerously impact
cycle structure; being as the constraint in endogenous puberty is +~1-3 pg/mL per cycle, it is likely to be significantly
lower than 200%.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">General: slow titration</h2>

<p>
Please refer to <a href="https://www.luciaillanes.de/de/etc/projecttransspace">Project "First Trans Person in Space": on insufficient HRT titration</a>
for an in-depth discussion of this topic.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">General: bloodwork pre-HRT; normal total T and high SHBG pre-HRT</h2>

<p>
When starting HRT, it is very highly recommended - in general - that extensive blood testing be done in order to determine a
long list of serum levels, representing the pre-HRT state, and particularly including total E2 and total T as well as
SHBG.<br>
A consistently high SHBG pre-HRT that is not accounted for by diet, lifestyle, medication, etc. in conjunction with normal T
as well as, most likely, barrage of pervasive, (adult) life-long physiological as well as mental symptoms, may be indicative
of partial Androgen Receptor Insensitivity, as T is supposed to downregulate hepatic SHBG expression; this can be tested for.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Transdermal Oestradiol gel: 1.28g pumps vs. 1.25g</h2>

<p>
An unnamed brand of transdermal Oestradiol gel is claimed by the manufacturer to produce 1.25g of gel upon pump activation.
This is not the case, as anyone with a digital scale may confirm for themselves. Instead, 1 pump corresponds to ~1.28g of
gel with fluctuation in the µg range. This must be taken into consideration when estimating how many pumps a single bottle
contains, after substracting the very first "priming" pump.<br>
<br>
It is advised to integrate weighing the bottle after priming and after each pump with a suitable digital scale into one's
personal HRT protocol.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Transdermal Oestradiol gel: use pump gently</h2>

<p>
An unnamed brand of transdermal Oestradiol gel presents with an undocumented problem concerning its pump mechanism. If the
pump mechanism is engaged with excessive force as opposed to gently, it will, given 2 pumps p/d, predictably and reliably
break after about 21 days/3 weeks, at which point each pump will exceed 1.28g by a steadily increasing amount, as anyone with
a digital scale may confirm for themselves.<br>
<br>
It is advised to integrate weighing the bottle after priming and after each pump with a suitable digital scale into one's
personal HRT protocol.

</h3>

<p>
As seen above, transdermal Oestradiol gel of whichever brand or manufacturer will generally present with a concentration
curve across time as opposed to (ignoring brief peaks) stable levels, such as is the case with oral Oestradiol. This must be
taken into consideration when attempting to determine serum levels as follows:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Assay <strong>Cmax</strong>, e.g. the maximum or peak concentration at the <strong>3 hour mark</strong>
		(Tmax.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Assay <strong>Cmin</strong>, e.g. the minimum or trough concentration at the <strong>12 hour mark</strong>
		(Tmin,) e.g. right before the next dose.
	</li>
	<li>
		Calculate <strong>Cmean</strong>, e.g. the average concentration, by, based on <strong>Cmax</strong>,
		<strong>Tmax</strong>, <strong>Cmin</strong>, <strong>Tmin</strong>, finding the Area Under the Curve
		(AUC,)<a href="#r6" style="font-size: small">[6]</a> utilising the logarithmic method (((c1 - c2) /
		(LN(c1) - LN(c2))) * (t2 - t1)) during the absorption phase (rising levels) and the linear method (1/2 * (c1
		+ c2) * (t2 - t1)) during the elimination phase (falling levels.) This yields the maximum total exposure
		during that time period which, when divided by that same time period, e.g. 24 hours, will yield the maximum
		average concentration.<br>
		This is the most meaningful and important of the three pharmacokinetic parameters. Unless otherwise
		specified, any source specifying Oestradiol serum levels will refer to average concentration (Cmean.)
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Transdermal Oestradiol gel: suboptimal concentration curve</h2>

</h3>

<p>
As seen above, transdermal Oestradiol gel of whichever brand or manufacturer will generally present with a concentration
curve with a considerable peak-to-trough ratio and two peaks and two troughs p/d. It bears mentioning that this can be
suboptimal for the same reason as with the concentration curve of Oestradiol Valerate.

"Steroid deprivation, for instance, can have a major impact on the growth stimulation by E2. Estrogen sensitivity can be
increased easily by four log-units or more (Masamura et al., 1995; Chan et al., 2002) (Fig. 1). This effect may be explained,
at least partly, by a 100-fold higher level of ER(s) (Zajchowski et al., 1993), but coactivator sensitivity as well as the
degree of phosphorylation of transactivation factors (TAF-1 and/or TAF-2) may also be crucial."<br>
