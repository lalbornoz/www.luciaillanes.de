رَمَتني بَناتُ الدَهرِ مِن حَيثُ لا أَرى<br>
فَكَيفَ لِمَن يُرمى وَلَيسَ بِرامِ<br>

The daughters of time<a href="#r1" style="font-size: small">[1]</a> have shot me, from where, I cannot see<br>
and what of him who is shot when he is not shooting?<br>
<br>
And had they shot me with arrows, I would've guarded against them<br>
but I am shot at with that which is not arrow nor dart!<br>
<br>
When my people would see me, they'd say: were you not<br>
vigorous, young, of sharp and bright armour, and no sluggish fighter!<br>
<br>
I am taken and cannot take of time a single night<a href="#r2" style="font-size: small">[2]</a><br>
for what I take does not take from time but a thread<a href="#r3" style="font-size: small">[3]</a><br>
<br>
So I wear out in hope for that<a href="#r4" style="font-size: small">[4]</a> day, for that night<br>
and in hope for that year, and then year after year<br>

[1] e.g the vicissitudes of time, destiny, fate, etc. In tribal and particularly patriarchal societies, which the Arabian societies at the time certainly were, daughters are unfortunately of little to no to less than no value owing to the primacy of patrilineal descent on one hand and the political dimensions of kinship through marriage on the other - sons afford alliances, strengthening of safety, power, and status, and, of course, furthering bloodlines, whereas daughters are married off and provide neither.<br>
This poem was composed near the end of the poet's life, who attained the age of around 91-92 years, highly unusual for his day and age, and recalls his days of youth.<br>

[2] e.g. the poet is, on one hand, taken by time, fate, etc., wasted thereby, perishing therefrom, yet he cannot, in return, take away from time a single night for it is not his to take and time is inexhaustible. This half-verse pair is difficult to render in English as the poet uses the same verb - (it) ʔafnā, mā (not) (it) ʔafnā, lam (not-future) (it) yufni, (I) ʔafnaytu - throughout, with different shades of meaning and aspect/tense signifying: to waste/perish/be destroyed/annihilated, to exhaust/cause to cease/vanish/come to an end, to waste, etc., to exhaust, etc., resp.<br>
