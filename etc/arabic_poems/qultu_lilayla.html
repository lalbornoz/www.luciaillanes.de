I said to Laylā<a href="#r1" style="font-size: small">[1]</a>: what is the remedy for my sleeplessness?<br>
She said: our reunion by the coming of dawn<br>

I said to Laylā: how brief the times of our reunions are<br>
She said: and how tormenting the briefness<br>
<br>
I said to Laylā: my body has become exhausted from our longing<br>
She said: may God be your remedy for I have heard you<br>

I said to Laylā: and who has attested to my state?<br>
She said: my face attests to your touch and trace<br>

I said to Laylā: how many have perished from your love?<br>
She said: have you counted the waves of all the seas?<br>

[1] Laylā of the tribe b. ʕāmir just as the poet, Qays b. al-Mulawwaḥ, known as "Majnūn" as in "crazy"
originating in his unfulfilled love for the former rendered beyond reach by, essentially, tribal
politics, both from the eponymous old traditional narrative known as "Layla and Majnun" of tremendous
popularity from the Maghrib to the Indian subcontinent and beyond, in great part also thanks to the
Persian poet Niẓāmī Ganjavī and equally so of great importance in Ṣūfi poetry<br>
