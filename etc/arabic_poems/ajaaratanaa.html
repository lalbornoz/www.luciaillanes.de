أجارَتَنا إنَّ الخُطُوبَ تَنوبُ<br>

[1] This poem was composed on the occasion of the looming death of the poet either after he fell ill - likely related to a life-long skin disease mentioned by that same poet in his own poems - when he travelled near the city of modern-day Ankara, Turkey or - as myth would hold it - after having been poisoned by the Byzantine emperor Justinian who was angered by his departure. One way or another, here, the poet, stood in a graveyard, addresses his soon-to-be very own neighbourhood of fellow dead folk and specifically, his female - deceased - neighbour, a stranger to him, and the poet a stranger to her.<br>

[3] On one hand, according to several sources (al-Aṣmaʕī, Abū Manṣūr al-Azharī, Abū Hilāl al-ʕaskarī, Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī, inter alia,) an actual - historical - mountain in the highlands of the Najd, known also amongst specifically Tribe b. Huḏayl as Kabkab, Ḫanṯhal, and ʕasīb, with Abū Hilāl al-ʕaskarī stating that it was actually near al-Madīnah. On the other hand, whilst said mountain had also then already turned proverbial a metaphor, standing for steadfastness and survival amidst dire circumstances, ʕasīb also refers to palm trees, towering like tall mountains, symbolising steadfastness, resoluteness, and so on, also.<br>

<span id="r4">
[4] This half-verse has turned famously proverbial since then.<br>
</span>
<span id="r5">
[5] e.g. whatever that one was pleased by in the past has passed and was not to last and does not, cannot, and shall not return. The pre-Islāmic Arabs did not truly believe in anything except for time - time ruins all - and hence, certainly no afterlife; hence also, on a side note, the peculiar obsession with rocks, boulders, etc. as they defy time. Thus, there is little reason to become overly attached to the pleasures and calamities that life may bring.<br>
</span>
<span id="r6">
[6] e.g. whatever time - the days, time, destiny, all synonymous with each other - has fixed, predetermined, preordained, etc. to occur shall occur eventually and inevitably and thus becomes near, when previously it was remote, speculative, and devoid of reality. Thus, there is little reason to become overly attached to what one may think may or may not occur, as whatever is to occur will anyway, one way or another, and only time knows what.<br>
