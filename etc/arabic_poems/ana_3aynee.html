My eyes are in endless sleeplessness extended<br>
from the pain of her departure and yet it does not suffice<br>
<br>
When will my eyes be fulfilled by her glance?<br>
that glance that belongs to her beloved, while my life passes by<br>
<br>
My love, what is a castle bereft of pillars?<br>
It is left behind and falls with the changes of time<br>
<br>
Her censorious sifting<a href="#r2" style="font-size: small">[2]</a> has cast me in her stream<br>
while my eyes cry a eighteen<a href="#r3" style="font-size: small">[3]</a> tears<br>
<br>
What she has done to me none may understand<br>
nor have her deeds an equal in modesty<br>
<br>
When will my destiny dispose of her power over me?<br>
Perhaps the lord is testing me with this affliction<br>
<br>
My love, were my very being to disobey your demands<br>
I would submit it to them regardless<br>
