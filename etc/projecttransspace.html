<h2 id="Problem" style="text-align: center">The problem: insufficient titration</h2>

<p>
This document proposes that all HRT protocols insufficiently titrate and overdose by severely violating physiological
constraints on titration of (at least) Oestradiol as present in endogenous puberty<a href="#r2" style="font-size:
small">[2]</a>, where changes in average concentrations are constrained to 1-3 pg/mL per each cycle<a href="#r2"
style="font-size: small">[2]</a>, and hence result in:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Lack of efficacy due to inadequate rates of transcription for the effective induction of a phenotypal shift
		wrt. secondary sexual characteristics.
	</li>
	<li>
		Lack of efficacy due to probable failure to effectively induce changes in methylation patterns additionally
		preventing a phenotypal shift, at the level of epigenetics.<br>
		This phenomenon is documented in <a href="#r3" style="font-size: small">[3]</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Needlessly adverse physiological inasmuch as mental side effect profile during at least an initial
		time period of 28-35 days owing to overdosing (including but not limited to: nausea, digestive and
		metabolical symptoms, "hot flashes"/thermoregulation, excessive energy levels and thyroid upregulation,
		insomnia, affective instability, fatigue/"mind fog", etc.)
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Solution" style="text-align: center">The solution: the puberty protocol</h2>

<p>
As a potential solution, this document proposes a protocol of very slow titration mimicking endogenous puberty that intends
to optimise for the highest safely available rates of transcription, significantly induce changes in methylation patterns,
and eliminate all adverse side effects associated with unsafe rates of titration as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		10 mg/mL Oestradiol Cypionate, SC or IM, 7 day schedule<br>
		<em>Caveat</em>: likely to require custom prescriptions as 40 mg/mL is often the lowest available
		concentration.
	</li>
	<li>
		Steady increments of 0.01 mL/10 µL corresponding to increases of +5-10 pg/mL<a href="#r4" style="font-size: small">[4]</a>
		in average concentration every 2 cycles, e.g. 70 days, subject to cycle length, taking into account the max.
		6 weeks time to steady state of Oestradiol Cypionate and max. 5 weeks time to steady state of SHBG as well as
		potential thyroid response<br>
		<em>Caveat</em>: considering endogenous puberty, this may still constitute insufficiently slow titration - if so, 5
		mg/mL Oestradiol Cypionate should address this potential problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		Corresponding to +25-50 pg/mL per year and assuming a target of ~150 pg/mL, a simulated exogenous puberty
		spanning 3-6 years<br>
		<em>Caveat</em>: assuming that gradients matter more than absolute fixed serum levels, no problems are to be expected
		from the resulting low average concentrations of Oestradiol across a significant time period, e.g. about a
		year to reach 50 pg/mL in the slowest case; note that this is not a problem in endogenous puberty at any
		point. However, it bears mentioning that this is an assumption. Refer to the <a href="#Rationale">Rationale</a>
		section of this document for an in-depth discussion.
	</li>
	<li>
		5-10 mg p/d Cyproterone Acetate or, ideally, any GnRH-ergic antiandrogen<br>
		<em>Caveat</em>: if Cyproterone Acetate is to be employed as antiandrogen, insufficient Testosterone suppression is
		unfortunately to be expected up until a certain Oestradiol threshold, corresponding to about 50 pg/mL in the
		case of the author of this document and a time period of about a year in the slowest case. This will likely
		require an individualised solution during that time period.

</ul>

<h2 id="Rationale" style="text-align: center">Rationale</h2>

<p>
It is firstly to be observed that:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		In endogenous puberty, for which a large body of sound data is available, the average concentration of
		Oestradiol as well as Testosterone is not stable across time and instead gradually rises from puberty onset
		to puberty peak in the form of a gradient, constrained to, in the case of Oestradiol, ~1-3 pg/mL per every
		~28-35 day cycle.<br>
		<br>
		This is of significance as endogenous puberty is the only known and empirically studied mechanism
		by which a phenotypal shift wrt. secondary sexual characteristics significant enough to produce either -
		generally - the masculine or the feminine mode in the bimodal phenotype constituting biological sex is
		induced in a non-pathological fashion. This implies that sufficiently high rates of transcription are induced
		and maintained as part of this process, as is manifestly evident from the observed phenotypal shift.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is a pervasive pattern in a significant body of anecdotal evidence, found on e.g. Reddit, of lack of
		efficacy of HRT in trans women and trans men of all ages, with all routes of administration, average and/or
		peak and/or trough serum levels, duration of HRT, etc. pp.<br>
		This is expressed either in the form of observed efficacy during a brief initial time period (months) or none
		at all at any point, even years, and that upon cessation of HRT for a time period of 2-4 weeks and
		continuation of HRT, this may be temporarily alleviated (keywords: HRT doesn't work/not working, HRT
		stops/stopped working, HRT etc.)<br>
		<br>
		It must be emphasised here that dismissing anecdotal evidence is not an option as data of higher quality is
		simply not available since, bluntly spoken, nobody talks to trans people. Hence, it is obligatory to comb all
		the available anecdotal data for the very strongest signal on the basis of the predicate of
		pervasiveness. Equally so, it bears reminding that HRT is itself entirely experimental "frontier science" and
		that evidence, data, models, studies, protocols, guidelines, etc. are far more often than not of a
		speculative rather than empirical nature, in great part for systemic reasons.<br>
		Hence, if a pervasive pattern of lack of efficacy of HRT and that the current standard practices and
		conventions by which HRT is administered, whichever they be, do not work for a large number of people exists
		in the data that is available, it cannot be dismissed a priori on grounds of data quality on both ethical
		inasmuch as epistemological grounds.<br>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is hence to be argued that sufficiently, sustained high rates of transcription correlate with gradients of gradually
rising average concentrations of Oestradiol across time - "stable instability" - as opposed to specific fixed serum levels or
even ranges thereof that are maintained stably across time. It would appear that little in the way of a rate of transcription
beyond the basal is to be gained from a state of hormonal homeostasis, such as would be expected from stable serum levels,
whichever they be, and much from a state of continually disrupted hormonal homeostasis, as long as this be constrained to a
safe range of rate of change, as it is in endogenous puberty, where the necessary rate of transcription is observed.<br>
<br>
Effective Oestradiol levels are to be seen as a function of both Free Oestradiol and Oestrogen Receptor (ER) density and/or
sensitivity in target cells as well as the corresponding gradient ("how much Oestradiol across how much time with what kind
of curve/gradient?"); the intricate dynamics of ERs with regard to down/upregulation of sensitivity and density by factors of
up to 100x and 10,000x, among with other factors, in response to specific Oestradiol curves is documented in, inter alia,
<a href="#r5" style="font-size: small">[5]</a>.<br>
<br>
Though an at once entirely separate and yet also related matter, it bears mentioning that exogenously driven Oestradiol
cycles exist, as observed by the author of this document and in the form of a pervasive pattern in a sufficiently large
amount of anecdotal evidence on Reddit, etc. The mechanism behind this is unknown though it would appear likely that the
culprit is to be found in the above mentioned ER dynamics as well as ER housekeeping within each cell, being as Oestradiol is
responsible in conjunction with ERs for making more ERs, constituting a feedback loop internal to each cell, see, inter alia,
<a href="#r5" style="font-size: small">[5]</a>.<br>
As observed by the author of this document, there exists a constraint on rate of change that is lower than 200% given any
average concentration, e.g. an increase from 50 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL (e.g. +50 pg/mL) is excessive and will dangerously impact
cycle structure; being as the constraint in endogenous puberty is +~1-3 pg/mL per cycle, it is likely to be significantly
lower than 200%.

<blockquote>
Finally, the GAHT model provided a unique opportunity to determine the proportion of previously published sex-specific
differences on autosomal chromosomes that are sensitive to hormonal influence post puberty. In total, GAHT affected 3% of all
sex specific autosomal DMPs, but 15.8% of age-associated sex specific DMPs (Fig 6; Yusipov et al. 2020). This indicates that
sex-specific DNA methylation that is present throughout life, from birth to adulthood, is hard-wired and determined by
genetic and developmental programs, and not susceptible to change in response to hormones. The second conclusion from this
analysis is that puberty-associated changes in DNA methylation can be induced in adults.

"Steroid deprivation, for instance, can have a major impact on the growth stimulation by E2. Estrogen sensitivity can be
increased easily by four log-units or more (Masamura et al., 1995; Chan et al., 2002) (Fig. 1). This effect may be explained,
at least partly, by a 100-fold higher level of ER(s) (Zajchowski et al., 1993), but coactivator sensitivity as well as the
degree of phosphorylation of transactivation factors (TAF-1 and/or TAF-2) may also be crucial."<br>
