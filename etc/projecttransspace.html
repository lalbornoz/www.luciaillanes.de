<h1 style="text-align: center">The problem: insufficient titration</h1>

<p>
This document proposes that all HRT protocols insufficiently titrate and overdose by severely violating physiological
constraints on titration of (at least) Oestradiol as present in endogenous puberty<a href="#r2" style="font-size:
small">[2]</a>, where changes in average concentrations are constrained to 1-3 pg/mL per each cycle<a href="#r2"
style="font-size: small">[2]</a>, and hence:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Lack of efficacy due to inadequate rates of transcription for the effective induction of a phenotypal shift
		wrt. secondary sexual characteristics
		<br>
		This phenomenon ("works, stops working" and "doesn't work at all") is pervasively documented in trans women
		and trans men of all ages, with all routes of administration, average and/or peak and/or trough serum levels,
		HRT duration, etc. pp. in the form of anecdotal evidence wherever one cares to look for it.<br>
		Similarly, the phenomenon of where the above problem may be temporarily resolved by stopping exogenous
		Oestradiol intake, waiting 2-3 weeks, and resuming exogenous Oestradiol intake ("restart/reset") is also
		pervasively documented.<br>
		<br>
		It must be emphasised here that dismissing anecdotal evidence is not an option as data of higher quality is
		simply not available since, bluntly spoken, nobody talks to trans people. Hence, it is obligatory to comb all
		the available anecdotal data for the very strongest signal, e.g. whatever pervasive pattern is present in a
		very large amount of anecdotal data (such as Reddit) cannot be dismissed a priori on grounds of poor data
		quality.<br>

	</li>
	<li>
		Lack of efficacy due to probable failure to effectively induce changes in methylation patterns additionally
		preventing a phenotypal shift, at the level of epigenetics<br>
		This phenomenon is documented in <a href="#r3" style="font-size: small">[3]</a>.<br>
	</li>
	<li>
		Needlessly adverse physiological inasmuch as psychological side effect profile during at least an initial
		time period of 28-35 days owing to overdosing (including but not limited to: nausea, digestive and
		metabolical symptoms, "hot flashes"/thermoregulation, excessive energy levels and thyroid upregulation,
		insomnia, affective instability, fatigue/"mind fog", etc.)
	</li>
	<li>
		More broadly speaking, the following concerns are neglected: gradients/curves ("how much Oestradiol across
		how much time with what curve shape?", "less is more") vs. arbitrary absolute serum levels and a general
		"more is more" attitude, effective Oestradiol levels as a function of Free E2 times the average sensitivity
		and density of Oestrogen Receptors (ERs) in target cells vs. arbitrary absolute serum levels, and the
		existence of Oestrogen cycles driven exogenously via an unknown mechanism likely directly relating to
		Oestrogen Receptor (ER) housekeeping within each cell as well as their changes in sensitivity and density
		across time, etc. pp.
	</li>
</ol>

<h1 style="text-align: center">The solution: the puberty protocol</h1>

<p>
As a potential solution, this document proposes a protocol of very slow titration mimicking endogenous puberty that intends
to optimise for the highest safely available rates of transcription, significantly induce changes in methylation patterns,
and eliminate all adverse side effects associated with unsafe rates of titration as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		10 mg/mL Oestradiol Cypionate, SC or IM, 7 day schedule
	</li>
	<li>
		Steady increments of 0.01 mL/10 µL corresponding to increases of +5-10 pg/mL<a href="#r4" style="font-size:
		small">[4]</a> in average concentration every 2 cycles, e.g. 70 days, subject to endogenous cycle length,
		taking into account the max. 6 weeks time to steady state of Oestradiol Cypionate and max. 5 weeks time to
		steady state of SHBG as well as potential thyroid response<br>
		Caveat: considering endogenous puberty, this may still constitute insufficiently slow titration - if so, 5
		mg/mL Oestradiol Cypionate should address this potential problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		Corresponding to +25-50 pg/mL per year and assuming a target of ~150 pg/mL, a simulated exogenous puberty
		spanning 3-6 years
	</li>
	<li>
		5-10 mg p/d Cyproterone Acetate or, ideally, any GnRH-ergic antiandrogen<br>
		Caveat: if Cyproterone Acetate is to be employed as antiandrogen, insufficient Testosterone suppression is
		unfortunately to be expected up until a certain Oestradiol threshold, corresponding to about 50 pg/mL in the
		case of the author of this document, corresponding to, assuming 25 pg/mL adrenal Oestradiol pre-HRT and +5-10
		pg/mL increments, 2-4 cycles, e.g. 70-140 days. This will likely require an individualised solution during
		that time period.<br>

<blockquote>
Finally, the GAHT model provided a unique opportunity to determine the proportion of previously published sex-specific
differences on autosomal chromosomes that are sensitive to hormonal influence post puberty. In total, GAHT affected 3% of all
sex specific autosomal DMPs, but 15.8% of age-associated sex specific DMPs (Fig 6; Yusipov et al. 2020). This indicates that
sex-specific DNA methylation that is present throughout life, from birth to adulthood, is hard-wired and determined by
genetic and developmental programs, and not susceptible to change in response to hormones. The second conclusion from this
analysis is that puberty-associated changes in DNA methylation can be induced in adults.
