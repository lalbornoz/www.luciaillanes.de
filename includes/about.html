      <br />
      I have 10 years of practical, hands-on experience in primarily network administration and systems programming on Linux, *BSD, and, within the context of OS development/theory, OpenVMS and Windows NT-based OS; this includes driver development as well as creating and maintaining infrastructure for my social circle of friends and associates.<br />
      <br />
      I am fluent in my native languages, Spanish (paternal, Chilean/Andalusian dialect) and German (maternal, Northern Germany/Hamburg dialect), as well as English (British English,) at CEFR level C1 according to personal judgment, and lastly Classical Arabic at CEFR level A2-B1. My personal interests and passions overwhelmingly revolve around Arabic and Spanish within the cultural and historical context of al-Andalus and its continuing relevance in Chile, Argentine, as well as Southern Spain.<br />
      <br />
      I am exclusively self-taught, highly adaptable and flexible, with a particular aptitude for fast-paced environments with fluid goals and requirements and as such, iterative and empirically driven development.<br />
      It is my belief that writing maintainable code is of utmost priority as a principle a priori in order to create reliable and secure software, both in terms of code quality measured by expressiveness as well as comments and documentation.<br />
      <br />
      Since February 2016, I have been a member of Midipix&#91;1&#93;, a POSIX/Linux-compatible development environment for Windows NT-based OS, providing the project with continuously maintained build/cross-compilation infrastructure&#91;2&#93;. This additionally involves, in an informal context on the project's IRC channel as well as mailing list, providing support to and initiating newcomers, be they developers or end-users, to the various aspects and components of Midipix.<br />
      During the months November-December 2016, I designed and implemented epoll/kqueue support on Linux/*BSD in the Tcl notifier&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;, primarily responsible for I/O event completion notification as part of a FlightAware bounty programme&#91;6&#93; to this effect.<br />
